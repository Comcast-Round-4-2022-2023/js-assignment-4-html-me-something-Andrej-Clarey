         <h2>My Evolution of the Dish</h2>
         <p class="evolution">In my first attempt at creating this dish I thought back to when i had seen it made by my Grandmother. When she made it she had added cherry tomatoes to the garlic, butter and olive oil. My wife, Amy, was not a fan of the acidity the tomatoes added so i ended up removing them in later versions. After making the dish a few times more I felt like it was missing something. Initally I added shallots and freshly shredded parmesan cheese. While the shallott added a nice compliment to the garlic, the fresh parmesan however just clumped up and detracted from the dish.In my final iteration I added fresh basil from my garden and that was the final missing piece! Through trial and error I have created Amy's favorite pasta dish!</p>
         <h2>Creating the Dish</h2>
         <p>To start gather the ingredients you will need:<ul><li>1lb peeled raw shrimp</li><li>2 shallott diced</li><li>5 cloves of garlic minced</li><li>1/2 cup fresh basil chopped</li><li>1 box angel hair pasta</li><li>2-3 Tbs butter</li><li>1 cup extra virgin olive oil</li><li>salt &#38 pepper to taste</li><li>2 Tbs Italian seasoning divided</li><li>1/4 tsp crushed red pepper flakes</li></ul>Next add the peeled shrimp to a bowl and drizzle them with 2 tsp of olive oil and 1 Tbs of Italian seasoning and stir to coat shrimp. Heat a large pan over medium heat and bring a pot of salted water to boil. Add the butter and olive oil to the pan with the shallott, after about 2 minutes the shallott will be translucent at this point add the garlic and continue for 30-60 seconds until fragrant. Now add the shrimp and fresh basil to the pan and the pasta to the pot of boiling water. Once the shrimp and pasta are fully cooked drain the pasta, reserving 1/4 cup of the pasta water, and add both the water and pasta to the pan, stiring to mix well. Remove the pan from heat and plate your dish! Grated parmesan can be added as desired once plated</p>
         <h2>Cooking Tips</h2>

Everyones tastes are different so never be afraid to expierment with any recipe. Sometimes it will be better, sometimes it will be worse and sometimes you will create a work of art that people will be requesting everytime they see you!</p></div>
